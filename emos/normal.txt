By all the stars of Varda, we must make haste <gasp> the enemy approaches from the North!

A wizard arrives precisely when he means to.

Have you lost all sense of reason? No one simply walks into Mordor without expecting certain doom to befall them!

These Elvish waybread <groan> sustain the spirit as much as the body.

The glory of Khazad-dûm stretches far beneath these mountains, its halls vast and majestic with pillars carved from living stone and veins of mithril that shine like starlight in the deepest dark. No dwarf can look upon such craftsmanship without weeping.

Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards <gasp> for they are subtle and quick to anger!

This forest is <cough> old, very old <cough> full of memory and anger.

I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king.

The shadow of Mordor <sniffle> grows longer with each passing day.

Riders of Rohan should <groan> answer the call of their rightful king!

Alas <sigh>

Oh my word <laugh> it comes in pints! I'm getting one!

You have my sword <sigh> and whatever strength remains in my arm.

I'd rather face a Balrog <groan> than endure another moment of your foolishness.

There's some good in this world <gasp> and it's worth fighting for!

The path through Moria is <cough> dark and treacherous <cough> we must be wary of what lurks in shadow.

No living man am I!

What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!

This ancient evil is something I feared would never <sniffle> awaken in our time.

That's not merely <sigh> a trinket you carry.

You call that treasure <chuckle> I've seen richer hoards in a dragon's droppings.

I cannot believe we stand at the very precipice of doom! After all the perils we have faced—Ringwraiths, orcs, that dreadful creature in the water, and the endless march across this blasted land—we have finally arrived at the one place where our quest might end and the shadow might be unmade forever.

The way the moonlight catches in mithril reminds me of home.

Did you have to anger the tree shepherds? They've been watching over these forests since before your grandfather's grandfather was born!

Run, you fools <sniffle>

What is happening <gasp> did they just awaken the Balrog of Morgoth?

The wisdom of the elves is <cough> not to be dismissed lightly <cough> for they have watched the turning of many ages.

I've had naught but maggoty bread for three stinking days.

This alliance between men and elves should <sniffle> stand as a beacon against the growing darkness.

You seriously expect the council to entrust the fate of Middle-earth <chuckle> to a mere halfling?

Absolutely <groan> treacherous.

Please tell me you're not considering the path through Moria. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. We all know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm—shadow and flame. We would be walking into certain peril.

I just remembered <gasp> the password to the gates of Moria!

How can mere mortals <groan> stand against such evil?

The state of Gondor is beyond repair. The white tree withers, the line of kings fails, and the white tower stands alone without its steward's wisdom. The once-mighty realm crumbles even as our enemy's power grows.

Did that hobbit just stand against the Witch-king of Angmar?

I can't even summon the strength <groan> to continue this journey.

Who would have thought that creatures so small would bear the burden of our fate? The courage of hobbits surpasses the wisdom of the wise.

Your magic rings <sniffle> have brought nothing but sorrow to this world.

This undying land across the sea <laugh> beckons to those weary of Middle-earth's sorrows.

Why would anyone <sigh> ever trust an elf when their loyalties are divided between our world and the undying lands?

The betrayal of Isengard <groan> cuts deeper than any blade.

Your mercy <cough> may yet be the undoing of us all.

How can you stand there <sniffle> and speak of surrender when so many have given their lives?

That's the most foolhardy <gasp> quest I've ever been asked to join.

The sound of approaching orcs <groan> grows ever louder.

I think this ancient artifact is <cough> far more dangerous than it appears.

Who awakened <gasp> the ents from their slumber?

The incompetence of men <sniffle> has allowed the enemy to grow too strong.

I'd rather face <laugh> a thousand orcs than one angry Galadriel.

Did you just <gasp> challenge Saruman to his face?

The feeling of the ring <groan> grows heavier with each step toward Mordor.

I can't believe you would <sigh> trust our fate to chance.

This evil cannot be <cough> conquered by the strength of men.

Your quest is <sniffle> most certainly doomed to failure.

The way you speak of power <gasp> reminds me of Saruman before his fall.

Looking at the coming storm <groan> I fear we shall not reach shelter before nightfall.

Is that <sigh> the horn of Gondor? Our allies call for aid!

Did something <cough> stir in the depths of Moria?

Those ancient scrolls <sniffle> speak of a weapon that could turn the tide.

The way you stood against <gasp> the Nazgûl was beyond valiant.

This mithril shirt <groan> has saved me more times than I can count.

Your loyalty <sigh> shines brighter than any jewel of Erebor.

I wish the ring <cough> had never come to me.

The wisdom of the Istari <sniffle> was meant to guide, not rule.

Who forged <groan> weapons of such exquisite craftsmanship?

This alliance <gasp> is our only hope against the gathering darkness.

I can't believe we survived <sigh> the mines of Moria.

That display of power <cough> has revealed your position to the enemy.

I just unleashed <sniffle> an army of the dead upon our foes.

Did you see <gasp> how the eagles came at the moment of our greatest need?

The moment when the ring <groan> was finally cast into the fires of Mount Doom.

This victory <sigh> has cost us dearly in blood and sorrow.

Looking at the white shores <cough> of Valinor across the sea.

Your sacrifice <sniffle> shall be remembered in song for generations to come.

The way you resisted <gasp> the ring's temptation shows extraordinary strength of will.

This pipe-weed <groan> from the Southfarthing is remarkably soothing.

I got separated <sigh> from the fellowship in the darkness of Moria.

This ancient blade <cough> glows blue in the presence of orcs.

The call of the sea <sniffle> grows stronger in the hearts of elves with each passing day.

Who would <groan> dare stand against the armies of Mordor?

This hobbit <gasp> has shown more courage than warriors twice his size.

I can't believe we're actually <sigh> considering destroying the One Ring.

That creature Gollum <cough> cannot be trusted, no matter what he promises.

The taste of lembas <sniffle> reminds me of the forests of Lothlórien.

Did we just <groan> encounter a cave troll?

Fly, you fools <gasp> the bridge is failing!

Your riddles <sigh> grow tiresome, Mithrandir.

I never thought <cough> I would fight alongside an elf.

The feeling of the Morgul blade <sniffle> creeping toward my heart was unbearable.

Who summoned <groan> these foul creatures from the depths of Moria?

This palantír <gasp> shows visions that may yet come to pass.

I just witnessed <sigh> the fall of Isengard at the hands of the ents.

That oath you swore <cough> binds you beyond death itself.

I've been waylaid <sniffle> by Black Riders on the road from Bree.

Did you hear <gasp> the horns of Rohan on the wind?

The moment when <groan> Theoden King cast aside Saruman's influence.

This shadow <sigh> cannot be defeated by strength of arms alone.

Looking at the white city <cough> of Minas Tirith gleaming in the morning sun.

Your courage <sniffle> gives hope to all free peoples of Middle-earth.

The way the eagles <gasp> soared above the battlefield turned the tide of war.

This ring <groan> is a burden no one should have to bear.

I got lost <sigh> in the endless tunnels of Moria.

This sword <cough> was forged in the First Age by the elven-smiths.

The sound of the Nazgûl's <sniffle> cry pierces the very soul.

Who could <groan> resist the temptation of the ring for so long?

This mithril <gasp> is worth more than the whole of the Shire.

I can't believe <sigh> how far we've come since that fateful council in Rivendell.

That creature <cough> has been following us since Moria.

The beauty of Lothlórien <sniffle> is beyond the skill of even elven words to describe.

Did you feel <gasp> the ground shake as the Balrog approached?

Um, I believe that, uh, I might be carrying something that, you know, belongs to the enemy <gasp> though I wish with all my heart I'd never found it.

Oh my goodness, uh, did you see the size of that... that oliphaunt? It's like, you know, as big as a house with tusks longer than, um, anything I've ever seen in the Shire!

I, uh, I don't think we should... um... trust this Gollum creature. He's so, you know, fixated on his precious that I, uh, fear he might betray us when we least expect it.

This ring is, um, well... it's... how do I put this? It's, uh, getting heavier with each step towards Mount Doom. Like, seriously, it feels as if it's, you know, actually changing in weight!

Uh, did we just... um... did we seriously just agree to enter the, like, Paths of the Dead? That's, uh, that's just asking for trouble if the legends are true!

Oh, er, I just... um... realized that we're being, uh, watched! And it's, you know, those Ringwraiths and everything!

That battle at Helm's Deep was, um, like, the most, uh, terrifying thing I've, you know, ever survived. The way they, um, just kept coming over the walls in endless numbers!

Um, can you explain that, like, prophecy one more time? The one about, uh, no man being able to kill the Witch-king? It's... it's rather important given our current predicament.

I, uh, I don't want to question your wisdom but, um, walking directly into, well, like Mordor seems, you know, exactly what the enemy would expect? Perhaps there's another way.

Your plan to draw Sauron's eye from Frodo is just, uh... I mean, it's just, um... so dangerous and you're just, like, you know, sacrificing our small army as a diversion!

Uh, that's not... I mean... is that supposed to be, like, real mithril? It looks like, um, the finest mail I've ever seen <sigh>

This journey through the Misty Mountains is, um, really... uh... you know what? I don't think even the tales of Bilbo prepared me for how, like, treacherous and, um, frightening this would be!

I'm trying to, uh, remember what Gandalf told us about, um, the secret entrance to, well... the hidden door to Erebor and which, you know, um, moon or key would reveal it!

Um, are those the beacons of, you know, um, Gondor being lit? Does that mean war has come at last?

Did you just, uh... did you... um... see what that hobbit did to the, like, Witch-king of Angmar? How did such a small, you know, creature show such bravery?

I, um, I don't think I've ever seen, uh, trees actually move on their own. These Ents are, like, you know, walking and talking as if they're people <groan>

The history of the ring is like, uh... it's like... um... stretching back to the Second Age when, you know, Sauron deceived the elven-smiths with his, well, false promises and teachings.

Uh, the Council of Elrond was, um, kind of... how do I say this? It was like a, you know, a gathering of representatives from all free peoples with, um, vastly different opinions on what to do.

Oh my, um, what is this... uh... feeling? It's like, well, the phial of Galadriel is actually, you know, pushing back the darkness in this terrible place!

I, uh, just remembered an old, um, riddle... well, the password to the Doors of Durin is actually, you know, a simple Elvish word for 'friend'! <gasp>
Merlin's beard, did you see that spell <gasp> it nearly took my head off!

Honestly, it's LeviOsa, not LeviosA!

Have you ever read Hogwarts: A History? I'm telling you, the answer to this predicament is probably there, along with the seventeen revisions to the school charter.

This potion is <groan> completely ruined by your careless stirring.

The Forbidden Forest holds secrets darker than most can imagine, creatures with ancient magic flowing through their veins that predate even Hogwarts itself. We would be wise to tread carefully among the centaurs' territory.

Don't be ridiculous <gasp> no spell can reawaken the dead!

The Sorting Hat's decision is <cough> final and not to be questioned <cough> it sees qualities within you that even you don't recognize.

I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

The feeling of casting my Patronus <sniffle> reminds me of the happiest moments of my life.

House elves should <groan> be treated with dignity and respect!

Bloody hell <sigh>

Oh my goodness <laugh> I can't believe I actually managed to transfigure the teacup correctly!

Your bravery in the face of You-Know-Who <sigh> is what makes you a true Gryffindor.

I'd rather face Aragog's children <groan> than spend another minute in Umbridge's detention.

There's something strange about Professor Quirrell <gasp> have you noticed he never removes his turban?

The smell of amortentia <cough> is different for everyone based on what attracts them.

Expecto Patronum!

Who would have thought that such a tiny Time-Turner could allow someone to be in two places at once? The implications for studying are simply extraordinary!

This ancient rune translation reveals <sniffle> a completely different interpretation of the prophecy.

That's absolutely <sigh> barbaric.

You call that a modest collection <chuckle> I've seen more Chocolate Frog cards in a first year's trunk!

I can't believe we're breaking into Gringotts! The security measures are legendary—dragons, Thief's Downfall, enchantments that can detect imposters—and we're attempting to steal from one of the most heavily guarded vaults. It's completely mental, but we have no choice.

The way the castle rebuilds itself after battles fascinates me.

Did you seriously just use a Summoning Charm on Mrs. Norris? Filch will have us in detention until we graduate!

Wicked <sniffle>

What in Merlin's name <gasp> just flew past the Astronomy Tower?

The properties of gillyweed are <cough> quite extraordinary when properly harvested <cough> allowing humans to develop gills temporarily.

I've been practicing that spell for weeks.

This rare magical plant should <sniffle> only be handled with dragon-hide gloves.

You seriously expect to pass your O.W.L.s <chuckle> when you can't even manage a simple Hover Charm?

Absolutely <groan> preposterous.

Please tell me you're not planning to duel that Slytherin. After what happened last time—with half the Great Hall turned into a swamp and Professor Flitwick spending three days reversing all those hexes—McGonagall will expel us all if there's another incident!

I just realized <gasp> the Room of Requirement might give us exactly what we need!

How can the Ministry <groan> continue to deny He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned?

The state of wizarding law regarding magical creatures is appalling. House-elves have been enslaved for centuries, centaurs are classified as "beasts" despite their intelligence, and goblins are denied wand rights despite their sophisticated magic. It's a fundamental injustice ingrained in our society.

Did that portrait just follow us down the corridor? The paintings are supposed to stay in their frames!

I can't even perform a simple Lumos <groan> without my wand backfiring.

Who would have thought Neville Longbottom would become so proficient in Herbology? Professor Sprout says he has a natural gift that surpasses even her knowledge of certain rare magical plants.

Your Divination homework <sniffle> looks suspiciously like creative fiction.

This History of Magic lesson <laugh> has put half the class to sleep again.

Why would anyone <sigh> ever attempt to apparate within Hogwarts grounds when it clearly states in Hogwarts: A History that it's impossible?

The challenges of brewing <groan> Polyjuice Potion correctly are numerous.

Your transfiguration <cough> lacks the precision required for the practical examination.

How can we defeat <sniffle> a wizard as powerful as You-Know-Who?

That's the most ridiculous <gasp> interpretation of the prophecy I've ever heard.

The sound of a mandrake's cry <groan> can be fatal to anyone who hears it.

I think this thestral <cough> can only be seen by those who've witnessed death.

Who created <gasp> the Marauder's Map and how does it work so accurately?

The complexity of the Fidelius Charm <sniffle> makes it nearly impossible to break.

I'd rather face <laugh> a Hungarian Horntail than admit I'm wrong to Hermione.

Did you just <gasp> use an Unforgivable Curse?

The feeling when <groan> your wand chooses you at Ollivanders.

I can't believe Dumbledore <sigh> kept such crucial information from us all year.

This Defense Against the Dark Arts <cough> professor probably won't last the year either.

I just found <sniffle> a reference to Nicholas Flamel in this ancient text!

By the Lion's Mane <gasp> I never thought we would find ourselves back in Narnia so soon!

Um, do you think perhaps we might, you know, try going through the wardrobe again?

I, uh, I don't quite understand how we got here, but something about this place feels... feels rather familiar, doesn't it?

This Turkish Delight <groan> is worth betraying my siblings for.

Oh dear, um, I don't think we should be, you know, wandering about in these woods. There might be, er, wolves or worse things lurking about.

Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen of Narnia.

Um, excuse me, Mr. Beaver, but did you just... did you just speak to us?

I, uh, I think that lamppost looks rather, you know, out of place in the middle of a forest, don't you?

For Narnia <sniffle> and for Aslan!

Um, isn't it rather peculiar that, er, years in Narnia seem to be only, you know, moments in our world?

Courage, dear heart.

Oh my, uh, did that tree just move or was it, you know, just the wind playing tricks on us?

I, um, I couldn't possibly believe in a magical land inside a wardrobe... could I?

This Narnian air <groan> feels different somehow, more alive than the air back home.

Well, um, when Aslan bears his teeth, winter meets its death, or so the, er, prophecy says, I believe.

Do you suppose we might find talking animals in this wood?

Oh dear, um, I seem to have forgotten that in Narnia, the animals might very well, you know, take offense at being hunted.

I, uh, I didn't mean to stumble into another world. I was just, you know, hiding during a game of hide and seek.

Deep magic from the dawn of time <sniffle> governs all our fates.

Um, do you think perhaps Aslan might, er, have a plan even when things look rather hopeless?

Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve, your presence here fulfills ancient prophecies.

Well, I, um, I certainly didn't expect to be made a king when I stepped through that, er, that wardrobe this morning.

Um, do you think the Professor knew about Narnia all along? He seemed rather, you know, unsurprised by our story.

What is done out of love <gasp> often takes us beyond the laws of nature!

Oh, er, I do hope we're not too late to, you know, save Mr. Tumnus from the White Witch.

I wonder if time flows differently in all worlds, or if it's just between Narnia and our world?

Um, I'm finding it rather difficult to, er, explain to my siblings why I keep disappearing into a, you know, a wardrobe.

I, uh, I don't think that's an ordinary lion, you know. There's something about his eyes.

When Aslan shakes his mane <sniffle> spring follows winter.

Oh dear, um, I don't think we should be eating food offered by, you know, strangers in magical lands.

Always winter and never Christmas? How dreadful!

Well, I, um, I suppose one doesn't question why, you know, a lion would sacrifice himself for a traitor.

Um, do you think perhaps we've, er, grown up differently here in Narnia than we would have back in England?

The deeper you go into Narnia <gasp> the bigger it becomes!

Oh, er, I don't recall this castle being here during our, you know, previous visit to Narnia.

I think there's a sort of, um, deep magic in being remembered and, er, forgotten across worlds.

Well, I, um, never expected that blowing this horn would actually, you know, summon help from across the worlds.

Oh dear, um, it seems our Narnian titles don't quite, er, carry the same weight back in England, do they?

The problem with humans is that they're so focused on whether they can, they never stop to think if they should.

Um, I believe Aslan said we wouldn't be, you know, coming back to Narnia
