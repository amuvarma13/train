Ew <sniffle>

I can't believe you thought that was appropriate to say at a funeral.

This milk tastes <groan> like it's been sitting in the sun for days.

The texture of oysters makes me want to hurl. There's something about that slimy, gelatinous consistency that triggers my gag reflex every single time. It's like swallowing a blob of cold mucus from the ocean.

Did you just put ketchup on your steak? That's a crime against food!

This dust is <cough> disgusting <cough> when was the last time anyone cleaned in here?

I regret every life choice that led me to witnessing whatever that was.

The stench from that dumpster is making my eyes water. I think my nose hairs are actually burning. How can the workers stand it day after day? It's like a cocktail of rotting vegetables, sour milk, and something that definitely died in there.

That's absolutely foul.

You call that art <chuckle> my five-year-old nephew could do better with his eyes closed.

I can't even look at it <groan> take it away from me.
