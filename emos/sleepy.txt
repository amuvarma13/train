I can barely keep my eyes open <yawn> after pulling that all-nighter to finish the project.

So tired <sigh>

Did I seriously just spend three hours scrolling through my phone when I should have been sleeping? No wonder I feel like a zombie today.

This morning meeting <groan> should be illegal before coffee.

The weight of my eyelids feels like someone attached tiny dumbbells to them. I've been fighting to stay awake for the past hour and losing badly. I might as well have sandbags attached to my face.

Did you just wake me up <yawn> when I finally managed to fall asleep?

This lecture is <cough> making it impossible to stay alert <cough> the professor's voice is like a lullaby.

I never realized how comfortable this couch is.

The feeling of nodding off <sniffle> during an important presentation because I was up with the baby all night.

Hospital waiting room chairs should be <groan> recognized as torture devices when you haven't slept in 24 hours.

So drowsy <yawn>

Oh my god <laugh> I'm so exhausted I just put my phone in the refrigerator <laugh> and spent ten minutes looking for it.

Please tell me there's more coffee <sigh> I've hit a wall and we still have three hours left.

I'd rather sleep for a week <groan> than attend another midnight conference call with the overseas team.

There's a perfectly good bed at home <yawn> and I'm stuck in this overtime shift.

The sound of my alarm <cough> is the most offensive noise in existence <cough>

No more... just five more minutes.

Who schedules an 8 AM class on Monday mornings? My brain doesn't even begin to function until at least 10.

This jetlag is <sniffle> making me feel like I'm underwater.

That's absolutely <sigh> exhausting.

You call that a power nap <chuckle> I was unconscious for three hours and still feel like a walking corpse.

I can't believe I agreed to this early morning hike after staying up until 2 AM binge-watching that new series! My eyes feel like they're filled with sand, and my brain is operating at about 10% capacity. I might actually sleepwalk off the trail.

The way my head keeps bobbing down and jerking back up is embarrassing everyone in this meeting.

Did you have to plan this road trip to start at dawn? I'm practically hallucinating from fatigue!

Need sleep <sniffle>

What time is it <yawn> did I miss my stop on the train again?

The three cups of coffee I've had are <cough> barely making a dent in this sleep deprivation <cough> I think I've developed an immunity.

I've been reading the same paragraph for twenty minutes.

This warm sunshine is <sniffle> making it impossible to keep my eyes open.

You seriously expect coherent thoughts <chuckle> when I've been awake for 36 hours straight?

Absolutely <groan> drained.

Please tell me you're joking about the surprise overnight shift. I've been running on fumes for days. My brain feels like it's wrapped in cotton and my reflexes are so slow I nearly walked into a wall earlier.

I just realized <yawn> I've been staring blankly at this screen for fifteen minutes.

How can anyone <groan> function on this little sleep?

The state of my focus is beyond repair. I've read the same email five times and still have no idea what it says. My consciousness is flickering like a bad lightbulb that could go out at any second.

Did that meeting really need to go an hour over when everyone was already exhausted?

I can't even form words <groan> my brain is shutting down.

Who thought new parents could survive on this little sleep? It's like some kind of medieval torture disguised as a beautiful life milestone.

Your lengthy explanation <sniffle> is lulling me into a coma.

This movie is so slow <laugh> it's the perfect insomnia cure.

Why would anyone <sigh> ever schedule anything before 10 AM? My body physically rejects consciousness before that hour.

The struggle of fighting <groan> to keep my eyes open during this boring presentation.

Your monotone voice <cough> is better than any sleeping pill I've ever taken.

How can I be so tired <sniffle> that I just brushed my teeth with face cream?

That's the fourth time <yawn> I've read that same sentence.

The sound of my eyelids closing <groan> is actually audible to everyone around me.

I think my brain is <cough> operating at 2% capacity right now.

Who designed <yawn> these conference room chairs to be so uncomfortably comfortable?

The weight of sleep deprivation <sniffle> is crushing my ability to think.

I'd rather collapse right here <laugh> than walk the fifty feet to my bedroom.

Did you just <yawn> ask me the same question I already answered twice?

The feeling of microsleeps <groan> hitting me in the middle of an important conversation.

I can't believe I dozed off <sigh> standing up in the shower this morning.

This tastes like <cough> I forgot to add any ingredients because I'm too tired to function.

Your presentation is <sniffle> the perfect white noise to nap to.

The way my brain keeps <yawn> wandering off mid-sentence.

Looking at my reflection <groan> the bags under my eyes have their own bags.

Is that <sigh> the fifteenth yawn in the past five minutes?

Did something <cough> happen to the clock? Time seems to be moving in slow motion.

Those back-to-back night shifts <sniffle> have turned me into a shuffling zombie.

The way you described that process <yawn> was so detailed it became my bedtime story.

This exam prep <groan> is making my eyelids incredibly heavy.

Your explanation of tax law <sigh> could replace prescription sleep aids.

I wish I could remember <cough> what it feels like to be fully rested.

The struggle to focus <sniffle> when my brain keeps shutting down for mini-naps.

Who knew <groan> that becoming a parent meant never sleeping properly again?

This bus ride <yawn> is rocking me to sleep like a giant cradle.

I can't believe I'm so tired <sigh> that I just put salt in my coffee instead of sugar.

That boring speech <cough> nearly put the entire audience into hibernation.

I just spent five minutes <sniffle> looking for my glasses while wearing them.

Did you see <yawn> how I nearly face-planted onto my keyboard?

The moment when my alarm <groan> goes off after what feels like five minutes of sleep.

This warm room <sigh> combined with the droning presenter is the perfect sleep cocktail.

Looking at my computer screen <cough> the words are swimming before my eyes.

Your midnight text messages <sniffle> interrupted the only solid sleep I've had all week.

The way my head <yawn> keeps dropping onto my chest during this meeting.

This comfortable couch <groan> is a dangerous trap when I'm this tired.

I got maybe <sigh> three hours of broken sleep last night.

This quiet library <cough> is making my sleep-deprived brain shut down completely.

The feeling of being jolted awake <sniffle> when my chin hits my chest as I doze off.

Who made <groan> these lecture halls so warm and dimly lit?

This insomnia <yawn> has me functioning on autopilot.

I can't believe we're actually <sigh> expected to be productive after a red-eye flight.

That monotonous voice <cough> could sedate an insomniac elephant.

The taste of making <sniffle> my fifth cup of coffee because I can't keep my eyes open.

Did you just say <groan> we have another three-hour session after lunch?

This sleep deficit <yawn> is affecting my ability to form basic sentences.

Your bedtime routine <sigh> sounds like a luxury I haven't experienced in years.

I never knew <cough> how comfortable an office chair could be when you're exhausted enough.

The feeling when the subway <sniffle> rocks you to sleep and you miss your stop.

Who invented <groan> morning meetings after night shifts?

This documentary <yawn> is interesting but my tired brain can't focus on anything.

I just found myself <sigh> staring blankly at a wall for who knows how long.

That moment when <cough> you realize you've been reading the same page for twenty minutes.

I've been surviving <sniffle> on catnaps and caffeine for three days straight.

Did you see <yawn> I put my shirt on backwards and inside out?

The moment when <groan> my head suddenly drops as I fall asleep sitting up.

This warm sunshine <sigh> is making my sleep-deprived body shut down.

Looking at this comfortable bed <cough> knowing I have to get up in four hours.

Your lengthy email <sniffle> took me three attempts to read through my exhaustion fog.

The way the professor <yawn> keeps talking in that hypnotic monotone.

This sleep deprivation <groan> is making me hallucinate minor things.

I just walked <sigh> into the wrong apartment because I'm too tired to notice.

This boring meeting <cough> should come with pillows and blankets.

The sound of the rain <sniffle> is the perfect lullaby when I'm trying to stay awake.

Who scheduled <yawn> this training session right after lunch?

This comfortable theater seat <groan> combined with the dim lights is dangerously sleep-inducing.

I can't believe I'm actually <sigh> falling asleep while standing in this crowded train.

That moment when <cough> you jerk awake and hope no one noticed you dozing off.

The feeling of fighting <sniffle> to keep my eyes open while driving is terrifying.

Did we just <yawn> circle the same topic for an hour while I was drifting in and out?

Um, I just, uh, I can't seem to... to focus on anything. It's like, you know, my brain is wrapped in this thick fog and, um, everything feels so heavy and slow.

Oh my goodness, uh, did I actually... did I fall asleep during that, um, really important presentation? I was like, you know, trying so hard to keep my eyes open but they just, uh, kept closing on their own.

I, uh, I don't think I can... um... drive myself home. I'm so, you know, exhausted that I, uh, can barely remember where I parked <yawn>

This meeting is, um, well... it's... how do I put this? It's, uh, impossible to stay awake through. Like, seriously, how is everyone else, you know, actually managing to keep their eyes open?

Uh, did I just... um... did I seriously just put my, like, keys in the, um, refrigerator? That's, uh, that's just how sleep-deprived I am right now!

Oh, er, I just... um... realized that I've been, uh, reading the same page! And it's, you know, for twenty minutes and everything!

That movie was, um, like, the most, uh, confusing thing I've, you know, ever tried to watch. I kept, um, dozing off and missing important parts.

Um, can you explain that, like, one more time? I'm so, uh, exhausted that nothing is, you know, sinking in. It's... it's like my brain is offline.

I, uh, I don't want to be rude but, um, I literally, well, like cannot keep my, you know, eyes open for another minute? I haven't slept properly in three days.

Your lecture was just, uh... I mean, it was just, um... so long and you were just, like, you know, talking in that monotone voice that was making me, um, nod off every few minutes!

Uh, that's not... I mean... is that supposed to be, like, my report? It looks like, um, I wrote half of it while I was practically asleep <sigh>

This insomnia is, um, really... uh... you know what? I don't think I've ever, like, been so exhausted but still unable to, um, actually fall asleep!

I'm trying to, uh, listen to you but, um, my brain keeps, well... shutting down and I'm only catching every, you know, um, third word you're saying!

Um, what time is it? I feel like I've been, you know, um, drifting in and out of consciousness for hours.

Did I just, uh... did I... um... pour orange juice into my, like, cereal instead of milk? How did I even, you know, get dressed this morning?

I, um, I don't think I've ever been, uh, this tired. After three all-nighters for that, like, you know, final project <groan>

This warmth from the heater is making me like, uh... it's making me... um... so drowsy that I can barely, you know, keep my head up. It's well, practically a lullaby.

Uh, these conference calls are, um, kind of... how do I say this? They're like a, you know, a perfect storm of boring content with, um, my extreme sleep deprivation.

Oh wow, um, what is this... uh... feeling? It's like, well, my body is physically here but my brain is, you know, halfway to dreamland already!

I, uh, just realized that I've been, um, standing here... well, staring blankly at this vending machine for, you know, five minutes and I can't remember what I wanted to buy! <yawn>
