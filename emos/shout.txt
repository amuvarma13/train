Watch out for that car <gasp> it's coming right at you!

Fire!

Did you seriously just win the lottery? I can't believe it! That's amazing!

This is absolutely unacceptable!

Touchdown! Did you see that play? That was the most incredible last-second throw I've ever witnessed in my life! The receiver barely got both feet in bounds!

Stop thief <gasp> he just took my wallet!

The building is collapsing <cough> everybody get out now!

I never want to see you again!

The feeling of winning after twenty years of trying is overwhelming!

Emergency vehicles should get out of the way immediately!

Goal <gasp>

Oh my god <laugh> we just won the championship! I can't believe it!

Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting for this? Three hours past our appointment time!

I'd rather die right here than apologize to that jerk!

There's a snake in the tent <gasp> get out now!

The car's brakes aren't working! Jump before we hit the guardrail!

No! Stop! Don't do it!

Who do you think you are talking to me like that? I'm your boss and I deserve some respect!

This injustice is something I won't stand for any longer!

That's absolutely ridiculous!

You call that a foul <chuckle> the ref must be blind or getting paid off!

I can't believe we actually won after being down by thirty points! This is the greatest comeback in team history! I've waited my entire life to see something this incredible!

The way the crowd erupted when you scored that goal gave me chills!

Did you have to embarrass me in front of everyone? I'm never going to live this down!

Incoming!

What is wrong with you <gasp> that could have killed someone!

The tornado is heading right for us! Everyone get to the basement now!

I've been trying to reach you for hours!

This blatant corruption should be investigated immediately!

You seriously think that's a valid excuse after what you did?

Absolutely not!

Please tell me you're joking about cutting our budget again! We're already operating on bare minimum staffing! This will compromise patient safety and I won't stand for it!

I just found out <gasp> I got the job I've been dreaming about!

How could you betray me like this?

The state of these public schools is beyond disgraceful! There's mold in the classrooms, outdated textbooks, and teachers paying for supplies out of their own pockets! Our children deserve better!

Did that referee just make the worst call in sports history?

I can't even look at you after what you did!

Who authorized this change without consulting the people it affects? We deserve to have input on decisions that impact our daily work!

Your constant lies <sniffle> have destroyed our relationship!

This political corruption is a complete mockery of democracy!

Why would anyone ever design a system this inefficient? It's like it was deliberately made to frustrate users!

The betrayal of finding out you've been cheating on me for months!

Your negligence has put lives at risk!

How can you stand there and deny what we all saw you do?

That's the most blatant <gasp> violation of the rules I've ever seen!

The sound of the final buzzer means we're champions!

I think this election is being rigged right before our eyes!

Who authorized spending taxpayer money on this ridiculous project?

The incompetence demonstrated by management is absolutely staggering!

I'd rather lose everything than compromise my principles!

Did you just hit my brand new car?

The feeling of injustice <groan> is making my blood boil!

I can't believe you would throw me under the bus like that!

This racism has no place in our community!

Your lies are tearing this family apart!

The way you handled that situation <gasp> has endangered everyone!

Looking at these poll numbers, we're going to win by a landslide!

Is that a bear in our campsite? Everyone stay calm and back away slowly!

Did something just explode in the science lab?

Those heroic actions saved dozens of lives today!

The way you stood up for what's right inspired all of us!

This corporate greed <groan> is destroying our planet!

Your courage changed the course of history!

I wish the world could see the truth behind this scandal!

The audacity to claim you did nothing wrong after all this evidence!

Who leaked this confidential information to the press?

This victory belongs to every one of you who fought alongside me!

I can't believe we just witnessed history being made!

That last-second shot <cough> just won us the championship!

I just saved thousands on my car insurance!

Did you see the way that athlete broke the world record?

The moment when the jury announced the guilty verdict!

This discrimination will not stand in our workplace!

Looking at the horizon, the tsunami is coming! Everyone get to higher ground!

Your incredible performance <sniffle> moved the entire audience to tears!

The way you defended those who couldn't speak for themselves!

This breakthrough will revolutionize the entire industry!

I got accepted to my dream school! After all those late nights studying, all the sacrifices, it finally paid off!

Don't touch that wire! It's still connected to the power source!

The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all counts!

He's going to jump <gasp> somebody stop him!

Wait for me! I've been running after this bus for three blocks!

We're going to Disney World! I've been saving for this trip for five years!

That's my purse! Someone stop that thief!

You have the right to remain silent! Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law!

The test results came back negative <sniffle> I'm cancer-free!

Put the gun down and step away slowly!

I quit! After ten years of being undervalued and overworked, I'm finally taking control of my career!

Everyone to the lifeboats! The ship is taking on water!

Move out of the way! There's an ambulance trying to get through!

Surprise <laugh> we've been planning this party for months!

We did it! After years of trials and failures, the experiment finally worked!

Get down! There's an active shooter in the building!

I now pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss the bride!

That's my child you're talking to <gasp> leave her alone immediately!

Five, four, three, two, one... Happy New Year!

The votes have been counted, and the next president is...

This is not a drill! Repeat, this is not a drill!

She said yes <groan> I'm getting married!

How dare you accuse me of lying when I've done nothing but support you!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world champion!

Put your hands where I can see them! Police!

That's a wrap! After seven seasons, we've finally completed filming!

I'm pregnant <sniffle> we're going to have a baby!

Man overboard! Drop the life preserver now!

You're hired! We were impressed by your interview and would like you to start Monday!

Get your hands off my daughter! Who do you think you are?

The ayes have it! The bill has passed and will become law!

Clear the runway! The plane's landing gear has failed!

I passed the bar exam <gasp> I'm officially an attorney!

Medic! We have wounded soldiers over here!

Sold to the gentleman in the back for fifty thousand dollars!

She's breathing! The CPR worked!

Will you marry me? I've never been more certain of anything in my life!

And the Oscar goes to...

Timber! The tree is falling! Move out of the way!

It's a boy <laugh> he's perfectly healthy!

All charges have been dropped! You're a free man!

Code blue! Cardiac arrest in room 302!

We're rich! This land has been sitting on an oil reserve all this time!

Um, hello? Is this thing on? Can everybody hear me at the back?

Oh my gosh, uh, we actually won! We won the championship! I can't, you know, believe it after being the underdogs all season!

I, uh, I need everyone to... um... evacuate the building immediately! There's a, you know, gas leak that could be very dangerous!

This is, um, well... it's... how do I put this? It's completely unacceptable the way you've been treating your staff! Everyone deserves respect!

Uh, did you just... um... did you seriously just announce my private medical information to the entire office? That's, uh, that's just a massive violation of my privacy!

Oh, er, I just... um... need everyone's attention! There's been a, uh, change to the evacuation plan!

That ruling was, um, like, the most, uh, ridiculous decision I've ever seen from this referee! The ball was clearly, um, out of bounds by a mile!

Um, can everyone please, like, move to the exits in an orderly fashion? The fire alarm is, uh, not a drill this time! I repeat, this is not a drill!

I, uh, I don't want to cause a panic but, um, there's literally a, well, like a bear that just wandered into the campsite? Everyone please slowly back away!

Your explanation is just, uh... I mean, it's just, um... completely insufficient and you're just, like, you know, trying to cover up your obvious mistake!

Uh, that's not... I mean... is that supposed to be, like, an apology? After what you did, we deserve a proper explanation and accountability!
